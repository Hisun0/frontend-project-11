# RSS Aggregator

## What is RSS means?

RSS (RDF Site Summary or Really Simple Syndication) is a web feed that allows users and applications to access updates to websites in a standardized, computer-readable format. Subscribing to RSS feeds can allow a user to keep track of many different websites in a single news aggregator, which constantly monitor sites for new content, removing the need for the user to manually check them.

## About application

My application can get RSS and parse it to readable format. Also it have a subscription to RSS (updates every 5 seconds)

## How is that look like?
